## Impetus for MilkMatch

### As a lactating mother, I search Facebook for other lactating moms. The most helpful group was [Dairy Queens](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DairyQueenMamas/).
### I also discovered [Human Milk for Human Babies](http://www.hm4hb.net/) a group for moms who have extra milk to share and mothers who need more milk for their babies. There are subgroups for different regions, so for example I joined the [Florida Human Milk for Human Babies](https://www.facebook.com/hm4hbflorida/?fref=ts). 
###You have to go to the page to see if there are any requests in your area. I wished there was a way I could get a notification on my phone of a mommy in need and a dedicated app for that so Mommies in need could search for mother's with compatible milk profiles. For example, some babies need milk that is dairy-free, soy-free, no medications, etc.
